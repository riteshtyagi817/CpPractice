1. while(cin >> x){ // code } // this loop reads element one after another,until there is no more data available in in the input.
2. getline(cin, in) where in is string in to read the line with spaces.
3. to read the input from the files and dump it to the files->
	// just place the below lines in the start 
	freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
	freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
4. the following code defines a long long variable:
long long x = 123456789123456789LL
5. g++ compiler also supports __int128__t but not not available in all contest systems
6. An important property of remainders is that the following formulas hold
(a+b)mod m = ( a mod m + b mod m ) mod m 
(a - b)mod m = ( a mod m - b mod m ) mod m
(a * b) mod m = ( a mod m * b mod m) mod m
7. An easy way to make sure that there are no negative remainders is to first calculate the remainder as usual and then add m if the result is negative:
x = x%m
if ( x < 0) x += m;
8. printf("%.9f\n",x); -- can be handly when printing the required precision
9. it is risky to compare two floating numbers with == but we can use below thing
if(abs(a-b) < 1e-9){
	// a and b are equal
}
